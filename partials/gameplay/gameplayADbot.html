        Most common botlaners will have an edge over you early due to either having 
        superior range or a stronger early game kit. Try only to trade with your empowered
        auto attack up or throw out the occasional q when you see a clear path. After level 6 your ultimate
        will give you the edge in most all-ins and gives you a fighting chance, so always look out for opportunities.
        If you are paired with a strong laning support like Leona or Pyke you should try to all-in constantly.

        As your teams adc your job is keeping an eye on your own position and kiting enemy divers.
        Watch your flanks and don't hesitate to use your ultimate to self-peel. You need to
        approach teamfights fundamentally different when playing ad, as your abilities
        will deal next to no damage and only serve a utilitarian purpose.
