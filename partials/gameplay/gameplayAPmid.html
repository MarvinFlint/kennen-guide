      <p>
        Midlane you will face mages or assassins most of the time that have either better waveclear or better zonecontrol than you do, so
        it is a rough place to lane. Your primary is mostly to play safe, farm and look for safe opportunities to harass.
        Your strong point, if you ever get a chance, is roaming to other lanes. Kennen is incredibly strong in skirmishes where other 
        teammates can set him up for a good ultimate.

      <p>
        Your primary objective in teamfights is to engage from a flanking position or to counterenagage when the enenmy
        team is going in. You can act both as a diver into the enemy backline (especially true with flash) or peel for your
        own carries with the cc you provide. The later the game goes and the more ap you amass the more devastating your are to
        squishy enemy carries.
